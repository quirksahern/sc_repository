all along the backwater
through the rushes tall
ducks are a dabblin'
up tails all

ducks tails
drakes tails
yellow feet a quiver
yellow bills all out of sight
busy in the river

how doth the little crocodile improve his shiney tail
and pour the waters of the nile
in every golden scale

how cheerfully he seems to grin
and neatly spreads his claws
and welcomes little fishes in
with gently smiling jaws
